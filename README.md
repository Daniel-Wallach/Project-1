## Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the global and United States economy. This analysis report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the economic effects of the pandemic on various aspects of the U.S. economy. By analyzing key indicators such as GDP growth, sectoral performance, unemployment rates, and regional variations, we offer valuable insights to help policymakers, businesses, and individuals navigate the economic challenges during and after the pandemic.

## 1. Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the global economy, including the United States. The widespread transmission of the virus and the subsequent implementation of measures to contain its spread, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing guidelines, have disrupted various sectors and caused significant economic disruptions. Analyzing the economic effects of COVID-19 is crucial in understanding the magnitude of the impact and formulating appropriate strategies for recovery and future resilience.

This data analysis project aims to examine the economic effects of COVID-19 on the United States by focusing on five major factors: GDP, employment, personal income, tax revenue, and home values. Each of these factors provides valuable insights into different aspects of the economy and helps us comprehend the overall impact of the pandemic.

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is a vital measure of economic activity within a country. Analyzing GDP is essential in this case as it helps us assess the overall economic performance, including the contraction or expansion of the economy during the pandemic. By understanding the changes in GDP, we can evaluate the magnitude of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery.

**Employment** is another critical factor impacted by the pandemic. Examining employment levels provides valuable insights into the labor market's response to the crisis. Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on employment allows us to assess the extent of job losses, the industries most affected, and the subsequent implications for individuals and households.

**Personal income** is an important aspect to consider as it directly influences consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Analyzing changes in personal income helps us understand the impact of the pandemic on individuals' financial well-being, savings, and consumption patterns.

**Tax revenue** plays a crucial role in government finances and public services. Assessing the effects of COVID-19 on tax revenue helps us evaluate the fiscal impact on government budgets, identify potential areas of strain, and inform policy decisions related to revenue generation and expenditure priorities.

The **housing market**, represented by home values, has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Analyzing home values provides insights into the stability and resilience of the real estate sector, which has wide-ranging implications for homeowners, investors, and the overall economic outlook.

To achieve a comprehensive analysis, this project examines the changes in GDP throughout the pandemic, analyzes the effects of the pandemic on GDP and employment in selected sectors, explores the relationship between COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates, and examines all five factors at the state and regional levels. By taking this multi-faceted approach, we aim to gain a clear understanding of the economic changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and provide valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and individuals as they navigate the recovery and plan for the future.

## 2. Methodology:
1. Data Collection:
   - Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): The BEA provides data on GDP, personal income, and tax revenue. The data for each year includes information at the state and regional levels.
   - Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): The BLS offers data on employment, including the number of jobs and the unemployment rate. Similar to BEA, this data is available at the state and regional levels.
   - National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL): The NCSL provides relevant information on economic trends and policies at the state level.
   - Census: Census data is used to gather additional demographic and economic indicators that might influence the analysis.
   - Zillow: Zillow data is used to assess the housing market, including home prices, sales, and rental prices. This data is collected at the state and regional levels.
   
2. Time Period Selection:
   - Pre-Pandemic Period: The pre-pandemic period is defined as the median data from 2017,2018 and 2019. This baseline provides a reference point for comparison.
   - Pandemic Period: The pandemic period data is obtained from the median data of 2020 and 2021. This allows for an analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic.
   - Post-Pandemic Period: The post-pandemic data is collected from the data of 2022. This period represents the recovery phase following the pandemic.
   
3. Economic Regions:
   - Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): The analysis is conducted using the U.S. economic regions defined by the BEA. These regions include New England, Mideast, Southeast, Great Lakes, Plains, Rocky Mountains, Southwest, and Far West. Regional data enables comparisons and identification of regional trends.
   
4. Data Analysis Techniques:
   - Summary Statistics: Summary statistics are calculated to obtain key metrics, such as means, medians, and ranges.
   - Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis is performed to identify trends and patterns over time.
   
5. Calculating Change:
   - Change Rate Calculation: The change in the analysis refers to the rate of change from the previous year. It is calculated as the percentage difference between the values of a given year and the previous year. This helps measure the growth or decline of various economic indicators.
